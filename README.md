# <TickingTimeBomb-Quiz>

## Description

My motivation for this project was to understand and apply my existing knowledge that I have accumulated for the past 5 weeks and my new knowledge of WEB API, tranversing DOM, the concept of creating and appending elements, preventing functions to go pass when the conditional statement returns false,and understanding the logical flow of saving and retrieving data from local storage.

I built this project from scratch because I want it to be easily accessible for anyone to play the quiz and entering and saving their initials into the highscore so the user can go back to see what they have achieved.
